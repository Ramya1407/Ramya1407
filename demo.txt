In the series, Doraemon is a male cat without ears who is sent back in time from the 22nd century to help Nobita. Nobita's future grandchild, Sewashi Nobi, sends Doraemon back in time to improve the circumstances of Nobita's great-great-grandfather. In a typical story, Doraemon uses a gadget to solve a problem for Nobita, but Nobita goes too far and ends up being punished and learning a lesson. 
Doraemon's most iconic gadgets include "take koputa (hopter)" and "dokodemo doa (anywhere door)". Hopter is a small helicopter propeller placed on the user's head, allowing them to fly.
